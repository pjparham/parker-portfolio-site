# Thank you for checking out my portfolio!
My name is Parker Parham and I am a fullstack developer. I have built multiple full CRUD applications using a variety of languages, frameworks, and tools including React, Sinatra, Ruby, ActiveRecord, and Ruby on Rails. I have experience with a variety of CSS frameworks. Currently the language I excel in the most is React, but I am a fast learner and seeking a company that provides training in their stack.
